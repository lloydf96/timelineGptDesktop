# About

Welcome to the Timeline Generator app powered by ChatGPT!

This app is designed to help anyone curious about a subject to create informative timelines quickly and effortlessly. Using the advanced capabilities of ChatGPT, this app can generate timelines based on URLs, specific topics, or your own input text.

## How it Works

The Timeline Generator app leverages the power of ChatGPT to extract key events from the text and arranges them in chronological order to create a coherent timeline.

## Key Features

- **URL-based Timeline**: Enter the URL of an article or web page, and the app automatically generates a timeline based on the content found in the provided link.

- **Topic-based Timeline**: Simply input a specific topic, and the app will generate a timeline centered around the topic you specify from Wikipedia.

- **Text-based Timeline**: If you have your own text describing events or details, you can input it directly, and the app will create a timeline based on your content.

The generated timeline is presented in a clear and accessible format. You can easily view, edit, and download it as a .csv file. The interactive table allows you to modify, add, delete, and rearrange events according to your preference. Once edited, clicking the "Update Timeline" button will instantly reflect your changes in the Timeline Plot.

Additionally, the app provides options to customize the appearance of the timeline. You can change colors and fonts for different elements, making it visually appealing and suitable for your needs. Moreover, you have the option to download the timeline as a .png file for easy sharing or inclusion in your reports or articles.

Note that we have restricted the total number of words to a maximum of 4000. A layer of content moderation was added before passing the text to the API, to make sure that the input text follows the OpenAI content moderation guidelines

## Disclaimer

While we strive to provide accurate and comprehensive timelines, please be aware that the results generated by ChatGPT may not always be perfect or complete. We recommend using the timelines as a starting point for further research and verification.

To continuously improve the app and identify and resolve any issues, we may store searched URLs and topics.
