# About

Welcome to the Timeline Generator app powered by ChatGPT!

This app uses ChatGPT to generate timelines based on URLs, topics, or text. Whether you're a researcher, journalist, or curious about a subject, this app helps you create informative timelines quickly.

## How it Works

The Timeline Generator app leverages ChatGPT to extract key events from input. It analyzes content, identifies significant events, and arranges them in a chronological order to form a coherent timeline.

## Features

- **URL-based Timeline**: Enter the URL of an article or web page, and the app generates a timeline based on its content.

- **Topic-based Timeline**: Enter a specific topic, and the app generates a timeline based on the topic you specify.

- **Text-based Timeline**: Input your own text describing events or details, and the app generates a timeline based on it.

## Disclaimer

Please note that while ChatGPT strives to provide accurate timelines, results may not always be perfect or complete. We recommend using the generated timelines as a starting point for further research. We store searched URLs and topics to improve the app and identify bugs.
